# MachineLearning_Scripts

Codes are written to compensate the learning from Machine Learning course by Andrew NG (CS-229) given in Stanford university.

Reference to syllabus: https://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-summer2019.html

All the algorithms are written in Jupyter notebook.

The Algorithms covered in this repository are

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Generalized Linear Models
4. Discriminant Analysis
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
6. Bayesian Linear regression*  
7. Gaussian Process
